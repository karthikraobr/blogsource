So! los gehts (german for here we go). Hello World! This is usually the first program developers' write to get the taste of a new programming language. I am new to blogging and hence this post! Considering how long I have been working with computers, I am pretty late to the blogging scene, but hey better late than never. I still haven't decided what I will be posting here. Stay Tuned, Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!
